# Multiply
The "Multiply" Tkinter code creates a GUI titled "Multiply" with two entry fields, a multiplication label, a "Result" button, and an outcome display. Designed with specific fonts and geometry, it handles ValueError exceptions for non-numeric input, providing a user-friendly multiplication experience.
